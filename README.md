# tictactoe-machine
An attempt to make a tic-tac-toe machine learning player with using SFML for graphics.

Keybinding:
t   => toggle computer vs computer mode for training
r   => clear/reset the tic-tac-toe board
c   => clear the statistics of number of games, wins, etc
F1  => saves the 'brain' of both machine learning players under the filenames of "MLplayer_1.txt" and "MLplayer_2.txt"
F2  => loads the 'brain' of both machine learning players from the files "MLplayer_1.txt" and "MLplayer_2.txt"
F3  => makes both machine learning players 'forget' everything they know
esc => closes the program

Needs SFML to compile. This project is written in C++.
